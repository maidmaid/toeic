# Moods

3 types of verb moods:

1. Indicative
2. Imperative
3. Subjunctive

Basically, we use verbs to indicate tense sush as past of future. In addition to showing the tense, verbs are used to **indicate a state of being or reality**. When we indicate state or reality, we are using the mood of a verb.

## Subjunctive Mood

The subjunctive mood is not common and is rarely used. Over time, it has almost disappeared from the English language, except for a couple of circumstances.

We use the subjunctive mood in the following curcumstances.

### Indirect Commands

- My boss demanded that I **go** to the meeting.
- She ordered that he **pray** for the damadge.
- He commanded that Hohn **change** his attitude.

### Indirect Suggestions

- She suggested that I **buy** the car.
- He recommended that I **go** to Wellington.
- My supervisor proposed that I **be** transferred.

### Indirect Requests

- They requested that he **be** present at the meeting.
- My friend asked that I **help** her with her assignment.
- She insisted that he **fix** the computer.
