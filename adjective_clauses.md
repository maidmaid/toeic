# Adjective Clauses

Definition of **adjective clause**:

> It's a dependant clause with a finite verb and sometimes a subject. It used to modify nouns and can never be used by itself.

2 types:

1. Relative Clause
2. Nominal Relative Clause

## Relative Clauses

Definition of **relative clause**:

> It's a type of adjective clause; therefore, it's a dependent clause used to modify a noun. A relative clause normally begins with a relative clause marker (pronoun), it always has a finit (main) verb, and it sometimes has a subject.

5 relative clause markers:

1. **who**: people
2. **whom**: people (object)
3. **which**: non-people
4. **whose**: possession
5. **that**: both people and non-people

2 types of relative clauses:

1. **defining**
2. **non-defining**

### Defining/Non-defining

Definition of **defining relative clause**:

> When the information given in the relative clause is **essential** for understanding by the listener.

Examples:

- The restaurant `which we went to last night` was very good.
- The cake `that my mother baked` is on the table.

Definition of **non-defining relative clause**:

> When the information given in the relative clause is **extra information** and **not essential** for understanding by the listener.

Examples:

- This pen`, which I have in my hand,` is red.
- John`, who is my friend,` is a teacher.

Rules:

1. Do not use commas with **defining** relative clauses.
2. Use commas for **non-defining** relative clauses.
3. We cannot use _That_ with **non-defining** relative clauses.
4. Proper nouns are used with **non-defining** relative clauses.

### How can I recognize a relative clause?

The quick and simple answer is "something is missing".

A relative clause begins with a relative clause marker. This relative clause marker is preceded by an antecedent - _the noun before the marker_.

- The `café` which is on Queen Street is very popular.
  > `café` is the antecedent.

### Antecedent

3 different positions in a relative clause:

1. `Subject` of the relative clause:
   - The `boy` **who fell over** is crying.
2. `Object` of the relative clause:
   - The `jacket` **which I bought** was on sale.
3. `Object of the preposition` of the relative clause:
   - The `university` **which I applied for** is in New York.

### When can I omit or not omit the relative clause marker?

4 cases where we **can omit** or **cannot omit** the marker:

1. When the antecedent is the subject of the relative clause, we **cannot omit**:
   - The man **who telephoned me** was quite rude!
2. When the antecedent is the object of the relative clause, we **can omit**.
   - The man **who I telephoned** was quite rude!
   - :arrow_right: The man **I telephoned** was quite rude!
3. When the antecedent is the object of the preposition, we **can omit**; however, the preposition must go at the end of the relative clause if it was orifinally placed before the relative clause marker (formal English).
   - The university `for which I applied` is in New York.
   - :arrow_right: The university `which I applied fo`r is in New Work.
   - :arrow_right: The university `I applied for` is in New York.
4. When the relative clause marker is followed by a "be" verb we **can omit** the marker.
   - The boy `who is sitting over there` is my son.
   - :arrow_right: The boy `sitting over there` is my son.
   - If the remaining word, or words, does not indicate a continuous action and does not have an object or complement, the remaining word(s) should be placed in the front of the antecedent.
     - The car `which is red` is the cheapest.
     - :negative_squared_cross_mark: The car `red` is the cheapest
     - :arrow_right: The `red` car is the cheapest.
     - The customer `who is waiting` is becoming impatient.
     - :arrow_right: The customer `waiting` is becoming impation.
