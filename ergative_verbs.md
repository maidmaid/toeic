# Ergative Verbs

Ergative verbs are like third state between active and passive.

For example, it is normal to say:

- I `broke` the window. (**Active**)

Or

- The windows `was broken` by me. (**Passive**)

Here it is more important to say that the windows was broken then by whom.

- The window `broke`. (**Ergative**)
- The window `broke` when John threw the vall it.

We can always put more information into an ergative clause if we need it.
