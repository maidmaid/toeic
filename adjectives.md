# Adjectives

Adjectives describe nouns.

Vowels (a, e, l, o, u) and consonants (the rest).

Syllables sound out the words.

| Rule | Base adjective (infinitve) | Comparative 2 things or people | Superlative 3 or more things or people |
| --- | --- |  --- |
| | handsome | more handsome (than) | the most handsome |
| 1ab | big | bigger | the biggest |
| 1 | good (irregular adjective) | better | the best |
| 1 | bad (irregular adjective) | worse | the worst |
| 1b | busy | busier | the busiest |
| 3 | fun | more fun | the most fun |
| 1a | old | older | the oldest |
| 2a | tall | taller | the tallest |

Rules:

1. Irregular adjectives change the word with comparative and superlatives.
2. Regular adjectives depend on how many syllables they have.
   - a) syllable adjectives generally add `er` or `est`.
   - a) generally 1 syllable adjectives that end in a consonant double the last consonant before adding the `er` or `est`.
   - b) 2 syllables adjectives that end in `y` change the `y` to `i` before `er` or `est`.
3. Some adjectives break the rule.

Example 1:

- He is a `handsome` man. (Infinitive)
- He is `more handsome than` Tom. (Comparative)
- He is `the most handsome` man in the world. (Superlative)

Example 2:

- My pen is `worse` than you pen (yours)
- My examination results are `better` than yours!
  - :information_source: The word examination can be shortened to exam.
- My exam results are `a little` `better` than yours. (adverb)  
- My exam results are `much` `better` that yours.
  - :warning: never use `more` + `er` adjectives

Example 3:

- My pen is worse than their pens.
- :arrow_right: My pen is worse than `theirs`

Example 4:

- Tim tams are my `favourite` thing in the whole wide world.

Example 5:

- She speaks English `well`. ((Adverb), simple sentence)
- Her English is very `good`. (Adjective)
- She speaks English `well`, but I speak it `better`. (Compound sentence, type 1)
- She speaks Englush well; however, I speak it `better`. (Compound sentence, type 2)

Example 6:

- Let's eat grandpa. (Sometimes a comma can save your life). Let's eat, grandpa.
