# Subject Verb Agreement

## Rule #1

A "`prepositional phrase`" **does not affect subject verb agreement**. Example:

- The box `next to the tables and the desks` **contain** some books.

Be careful of these prepositions: `as well as`, `in addition to`, `along with`, `together with`, `accompanied by`.

- John and Mary **are** happy.
- John `as well as` Mary **is** happy.
- My friend Andrew `along with` his mother **was** at the shopping center.

## Rule #2

A dependent clause sush as "`a relative clause`" or "`a noun clause`" **does not affect subject verb agreement**.

- The equipment, `whish is in all of the classrooms`, **is** new.
- The show `where we bought the shoes and the clothes` **opens** every day.

## Rule #3

When we use "`non-countable nouns`" (uncountable), the verb is **singular**.

- The `water` **is** cold.
- `Coffee` **is** a great drink.

## Rule #4

When we use `indefinite pronouns`ยน as subjects the verb is **singular**.

- `Everybody` in the teams **has** a uniform.
- `No one` on the police force **is** qualified to comment.

ยน someone, somebody, something, anyone, anybody, anything, everyone, everybody, everything, no one, nobody, and nothing

## Rule #5

When we use "collective nouns" as a subject, the verb can be **singular** or **plural**.

- My team **is/are** good.
- The government **is** in control.

If we make the collective noun plural, we must also make the verb plural.

- The government **are** in a state of flux.

## Rule #6

When the subject is a `gerund`, `to infinitive` or `a noun clause` the verb is **singular**.

- `Reading books and magazines` **is** important.
- `That you should eat fruit and vegetables` **is** important.
- `To go surfing every day` **has been** my dream for a long time.

## Rule #7

When we use `both singular and plural nouns`, the verb **must agree with the quantity**.

- `One fish` **is** happy.
- `Two fish` **are** delicious.

## Rule #8

When we use these `correlative conjunctions`ยน, the verb **agrees with the closer subject**.

- `Neither the techer nor the students` **understand** the question.
- `Not only the students but also the teacher` **eats** at that restaurant.

ยน `Neither...nor`, `either...or`, `not only...but also`

## Rule #9

When we use these two quantifiers are used as subjects, we must follow these rules:

1. `Either` + `singular noun` = **singular verb**.
   - `Either ice cream` **is** fine.
2. `Either` + `of` + `determiner` + `plural noun` = **singular verb**
   - `Either of the ice creams` **is** fine.
3. `Neither` + `singular noun` = **singular verb**
   - `Neither child` **likes** the movies.
4. `Neither` + `of` + `determiner` + `plural noun` = **singular verb**
   - `Neither of the children` **likes** the movie.

## Rule #10

We sometimes use nouns, which can mean nationality or language.

Therefore, we use these rules:

1. Language :arrow_right: singular verb. `Chinese` **is** difficult to learn.
2. Nationality :arrow_right: plural verb. `The Chinese` **are** friendly.

## Rule #11

When we use units of money, distance, weight or time, the verb is singular.

- `1000 meters` **is** 1 kilometer.
- `100 kilograms` **is** difficult to lift.

## Rule #12

When we use these quantifiers `some`, `all`, `a lot`, or `none` as subject, the verb **agrees with the noun**.

- `Some` people **are** nice.
- `Some` food **is** disgusting.
- `Not all` the fish in the sea **are** edible.
- `A lot` more people **like** snowboarding that skiing.
- `A lot` of his skills **come** from his excellent knowledge of grammar.
- `All` of her writing **is** great.
