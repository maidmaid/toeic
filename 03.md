### **Complex**: uses `dependent clause`

3 types of dependent clause:

1. Relative clause (Adjective clause)
2. Noun clause
3. Adverb clause

## Verb transitivity

**Transitive** (`Vn`) must have a direct object.

Transitive verbs always have an object.

- John ate `lunch`.
- Jane called `me` yesterday.
- The boy ripped `the paper` at the beach.
- My Mummy cooks `dinner` for the Mafia. (for the Mafia = prepositional phrase)

**Intransitive** (`V`) can take an indirect object.

An indirect object is a preposition + noun, or an adverb.

- The car stopped `in the driveway`.
- My mummy cookds `for the mafia`.
- The girl cried `for a long time`.

**Di-transitive** (`Vnn`) must have both a _direct_ and _indirect_ object.

- My mummy cooks `me` (IO) `dinner` (O) every day.
- My friend told `me` (IO) `a story` (O).
- Damien always reads `his children` (IO) `bedtime stories` (O).

Example:

- Transitive: My mother reads `books` (O).
- Intransitive: My mother reads `to me` (IO).
- Di-transitive: My mother reads `me` (IO) `books` (O).

## Aderbs

Normally `adverbs` are words that describe `verbs`.

Adverbs answer the following questions about verbs:

> How? When? Where? Why?

These examples show how adverbs modify verbs:

- He `easily` lifted the suitcase into the car.
  - How did he lift the suitcase? `Easily`
  - `Easily` is an adverb.
- We'll use the new software program `tomorrow`.
  - When will we use it? `Tomorrow`.
  - `Tomorrow` functions as an adverb.
- She parked the car `nearby`.
  - Where did she park the car? `Nearby`.
  - Nearby is an adverb.

Adverbs are the most moveable of all parts of speech. Examples:

1. `Slowly` he climbed the ladder.
2. *He `slowly` climbed the ladder*.(most common)
3. He climbed the ladder `slowly`.

Many adverbs end in `-ly`. Most abverbs are formed by adding `-ly` + `adjectives`:

- nice + ly = nicely
- drowsy + ly = drowsily
- quick + ly = quickly
- :warning: friendly = adjective

Like adjectives of more than one syllable, adverbs usually become **comparative** (more) and **superlative** (most). Examples:

- Tom played the tune `lyrically`.
- Jon played the tune more `lyrically` than Tom. (**Comparative**)
- Andrew played the tune most `lyrically`. (**Superlative**)

## Flat adverbs = unchanged from adjective form

Definition of **flat adverbs**:

> adjectives that do not change form (add -ly) to be become adverbs.

Examples: early, late, hard, fast, long, high, low, deep, and near.

To determine whether these words are functionning as adjectives or adverbs, you must dertermine:

1. What the word is describing? Noun or verb?
2. What question the word is answering?

Example :one::

- `Early` as adjective: _The `early` train arrives at 8:45am._ :arrow_right: `Early` describes the noun train and answers the question "Which one?".
- `Early` as adverb: _The 8:45 train arrived early._ :arrow_right: `Early` describes the verb arrived and answers the question "when?".

Example :two::

- `Hard` as adjective: _The teacher gave a hard test._ :arrow_right: `Hard` describes the noun test and answers the question "what kind?".
- `Hard` as adverb: _He threw the ball hard._ :arrow_right: `Hard` describes the verb threw and answers the question "How?".

Example :three::

- `Fast` as adjective: _He drives a `fast` car._ :arrow_right: `Fast` describes what kind of car.
- `Fast` as adverb: _He drives fast._ :arrow_right: `Fast` describes how he drives.

Adverbs modify Verbs, adjectives and other Adverbs. Examples:

- He `never` ceases to amaze me. :arrow_right: modifies the **verb** "ceases".
- She is a `very` interesting scientist. :arrow_right: modifies the **adjective** "interesting".
- He is `sometimes` quite boring. :arrow_right: modifies the **adverb** "quite".

## Subject Verb Agreement

### Rule #1

A "`prepositional phrase`" **does not affect subject verb agreement**. Example:

- The box `next to the tables and the desks` **contain** some books.

Be careful of these prepositions: `as well as`, `in addition to`, `along with`, `together with`, `accompanied by`.

- John and Mary **are** happy.
- John `as well as` Mary **is** happy.
- My friend Andrew `along with` his mother **was** at the shopping center.

### Rule #2

A dependent clause sush as "`a relative clause`" or "`a noun clause`" **does not affect subject verb agreement**.

- The equipment, `whish is in all of the classrooms`, **is** new.
- The show `where we bought the shoes and the clothes` **opens** every day.

### Rule #3

When we use "`non-countable nouns`" (uncountable), the verb is **singular**.

- The `water` **is** cold.
- `Coffee` **is** a great drink.

### Rule #4

When we use `indefinite pronouns`ยน as subjects the verb is **singular**.

- `Everybody` in the teams **has** a uniform.
- `No one` on the police force **is** qualified to comment.

ยน someone, somebody, something, anyone, anybody, anything, everyone, everybody, everything, no one, nobody, and nothing

### Rule #5

When we use "collective nouns" as a subject, the verb can be **singular** or **plural**.

- My team **is/are** good.
- The government **is** in control.

If we make the collective noun plural, we must also make the verb plural.

- The government **are** in a state of flux.

### Rule #6

When the subject is a `gerund`, `to infinitive` or `a noun clause` the verb is **singular**.

- `Reading books and magazines` **is** important.
- `That you should eat fruit and vegetables` **is** important.
- `To go surfing every day` **has been** my dream for a long time.

### Rule #7

When we use `both singular and plural nouns`, the verb **must agree with the quantity**.

- `One fish` **is** happy.
- `Two fish` **are** delicious.

### Rule #8

When we use these `correlative conjunctions`ยน, the verb **agrees with the closer subject**.

- `Neither the techer nor the students` **understand** the question.
- `Not only the students but also the teacher` **eats** at that restaurant.

ยน `Neither...nor`, `either...or`, `not only...but also`

### Rule #9

When we use these two quantifiers are used as subjects, we must follow these rules:

1. `Either` + `singular noun` = **singular verb**.
   - `Either ice cream` **is** fine.
2. `Either` + `of` + `determiner` + `plural noun` = **singular verb**
   - `Either of the ice creams` **is** fine.
3. `Neither` + `singular noun` = **singular verb**
   - `Neither child` **likes** the movies.
4. `Neither` + `of` + `determiner` + `plural noun` = **singular verb**
   - `Neither of the children` **likes** the movie.

### Rule #10

We sometimes use nouns, which can mean nationality or language.

Therefore, we use these rules:

1. Language :arrow_right: singular verb. `Chinese` **is** difficult to learn.
2. Nationality :arrow_right: plural verb. `The Chinese` **are** friendly.

### Rule #11

When we use units of money, distance, weight or time, the verb is singular.

- `1000 meters` **is** 1 kilometer.
- `100 kilograms` **is** difficult to lift.

### Rule #12

When we use these quantifiers `some`, `all`, `a lot`, or `none` as subject, the verb **agrees with the noun**.

- `Some` people **are** nice.
- `Some` food **is** disgusting.
- `Not all` the fish in the sea **are** edible.
- `A lot` more people **like** snowboarding that skiing.
- `A lot` of his skills **come** from his excellent knowledge of grammar.
- `All` of her writing **is** great.

## Moods

3 types of verb moods:

1. Indicative
2. Imperative
3. Subjunctive

Basically, we use verbs to indicate tense sush as past of future. In addition to showing the tense, verbs are used to **indicate a state of being or reality**. When we indicate state or reality, we are using the mood of a verb.

### Subjunctive Mood

The subjunctive mood is not common and is rarely used. Over time, it has almost disappeared from the English language, except for a couple of circumstances.

We use the subjunctive mood in the following curcumstances.

#### Indirect Commands

- My boss demanded that I **go** to the meeting.
- She ordered that he **pray** for the damadge.
- He commanded that Hohn **change** his attitude.

#### Indirect Suggestions

- She suggested that I **buy** the car.
- He recommended that I **go** to Wellington.
- My supervisor proposed that I **be** transferred.

#### Indirect Requests

- They requested that he **be** present at the meeting.
- My friend asked that I **help** her with her assignment.
- She insisted that he **fix** the computer.

## Complements

3 types of subject complements:

1. `Adjective` complement:
   - She is `beautiful`.
   - She appeared `happy`.
   - The food tates `delicious`.
2. `Adverb` complement:
   - I am `at the beach`.
   - She drives `carefully`.
   - The children are playing `upstairs`.
3. `Noun` complement:
   - John is `a teacher`.
   - He is a great `athlete`.

## Adjective Clauses

Definition of **adjective clause**:

> It's a dependant clause with a finite verb and sometimes a subject. It used to modify nouns and can never be used by itself.

2 types:

1. Relative Clause
2. Nominal Relative Clause

### Relative Clauses

Definition of **relative clause**:

> It's a type of adjective clause; therefore, it's a dependent clause used to modify a noun. A relative clause normally begins with a relative clause marker (pronoun), it always has a finit (main) verb, and it sometimes has a subject.

5 relative clause markers:

1. **who**: people
2. **whom**: people (object)
3. **which**: non-people
4. **whose**: possession
5. **that**: both people and non-people

2 types of relative clauses:

1. **defining**
2. **non-defining**

#### Defining/Non-defining

Definition of **defining relative clause**:

> When the information given in the relative clause is **essential** for understanding by the listener.

Examples:

- The restaurant `which we went to last night` was very good.
- The cake `that my mother baked` is on the table.

Definition of **non-defining relative clause**:

> When the information given in the relative clause is **extra information** and **not essential** for understanding by the listener.

Examples:

- This pen`, which I have in my hand,` is red.
- John`, who is my friend,` is a teacher.

Rules:

1. Do not use commas with **defining** relative clauses.
2. Use commas for **non-defining** relative clauses.
3. We cannot use _That_ with **non-defining** relative clauses.
4. Proper nouns are used with **non-defining** relative clauses.

#### How can I recognize a relative clause?

The quick and simple answer is "something is missing".

A relative clause begins with a relative clause marker. This relative clause marker is preceded by an antecedent - _the noun before the marker_.

- The `cafรฉ` which is on Queen Street is very popular.
  > `cafรฉ` is the antecedent.

#### Antecedent

3 different positions in a relative clause:

1. `Subject` of the relative clause:
   - The `boy` **who fell over** is crying.
2. `Object` of the relative clause:
   - The `jacket` **which I bought** was on sale.
3. `Object of the preposition` of the relative clause:
   - The `university` **which I applied for** is in New York.

#### When can I omit or not omit the relative clause marker?

4 cases where we **can omit** or **cannot omit** the marker:

1. When the antecedent is the subject of the relative clause, we **cannot omit**:
   - The man **who telephoned me** was quite rude!
2. When the antecedent is the object of the relative clause, we **can omit**.
   - The man **who I telephoned** was quite rude!
   - :arrow_right: The man **I telephoned** was quite rude!
3. When the antecedent is the object of the preposition, we **can omit**; however, the preposition must go at the end of the relative clause if it was orifinally placed before the relative clause marker (formal English).
   - The university `for which I applied` is in New York.
   - :arrow_right: The university `which I applied fo`r is in New Work.
   - :arrow_right: The university `I applied for` is in New York.
4. When the relative clause marker is followed by a "be" verb we **can omit** the marker.
   - The boy `who is sitting over there` is my son.
   - :arrow_right: The boy `sitting over there` is my son.
   - If the remaining word, or words, does not indicate a continuous action and does not have an object or complement, the remaining word(s) should be placed in the front of the antecedent.
     - The car `which is red` is the cheapest.
     - :negative_squared_cross_mark: The car `red` is the cheapest
     - :arrow_right: The `red` car is the cheapest.
     - The customer `who is waiting` is becoming impatient.
     - :arrow_right: The customer `waiting` is becoming impation.
