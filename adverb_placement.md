# Adverb placement

Definition:
> Adverb placement refers to the position in a sentence that an adverb takes.

> When we look at adverb placement, we can see 3 positions in the sentence or clause.

3 positions:

1. at the beginning (initial / front position)
2. in the middle, normally before the verb or after the auxiliary (mid position)
3. at the end (end position)

## Initial Position

| Patern | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `Adverb + S + Verb` | **Sometimes** we go the beach at the weekend. |
| `Adverb + S + AV + Verb` | **Fortunately**, we had caught our bus in time. |
| `Adverb + S + AV + AV + Verb` | **However**, the price will have changed. |
| `Adverb + S + is/am/are/was/were + Object` | **Occasionnaly**, she is at the park. |

## MP - Mid-Position

| Patern | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `S + Adverb + Verb` | We **sometimes** go to the beach at the weekend. |
| `S + AV + Adverb + Verb` | I will **always** remember your kindness. |
| `S + AV + Adverb + AV + Verb` | I should **never** had told you my secret. |
| `S + is/am/are/was/were + Adverb` | She is **seldom** on time to work. |

## EP - End Position

| Patern | Example |

| `S + Verb + Adverb` | He brushes his teeth **every day**. |
| `S + AV + Verb + Adverb` | I have finished it **already**. |
| `S + AV + AV + Verb + Adverb` | I will have studied **every day** by the time I graduate from Langports. |
| `S + is/am/are/was/were + Complement + Adverb` | She is nice to me **every day**. (all the time, quite often) |

## Adverbs of Frequency

We normally use the Mid-Position.

- I can always understand his English.
- They have never been to Tahiti.
- She sometimes goes to the movies.

:warning: _always_ can never be used in the front or end position.

- :negative_squared_cross_mark: **Always** she dows her homework.
- :negative_squared_cross_mark: She does her homework **always**.
- :ballot_box_with_check: She **always** does her homework.

However, when we use the imperative mood, we can begin a sentence or clause with always.

- **Always** wash your hands begore eating.
- **Always** study hard!

## Adverbs of Definite Frequency (Time)

It indicates when or how often.

Examples: yesterdy, soon, today, monthly, finally, in May, every year.

We normally use the **End Position**.

- Susie is going to Byron Bay **today**.
- The company pays their taxes **monthly**.
- Janelle works hard **every day**.

Theses adverbs can also be used in the mid position: already, soon, finally, eventually.

- Jose has already finished his assignment.
- Shw will soon graduate university.
- The finnaly decided toi get married.

These adverbs can be used only in the mid position:

- Nadine still likes eating chocolate.
- Anna just left her office.

## Special Rules for STILL & YET

These markers have the same meaning in the following sentences:

- She has not arrived yet.
- She still has not arrived.

We can also use "yet" in the mid-position, but we must use "yet to + inf".

- She has yet to arrive.
- Matt is yet to make a decision.

It has exaclty the same meaning as, "She has not arrived yet."

Still

If we use a negative sentence, "still" must come directly after the subject:

- :negative_squared_cross_mark: He is still not here.
- :ballot_box_with_check: He still is not here.

## Adverbs of Certainty

Adverbs of cerainty show how certain of sure we are of something: definitely, certainly, probably, clearly, obviously.

- I can **probably** come to your house at 6pm.
- They will **definitely** be late!

These adverbs must be used in the front position: maybe, perhaps.

- Perhaps, I will tell him about the proprosal.

##  Adverbs of Manner

We normally use the end position.

:warning: Adverbs of manner which are used to give the speaker's opinion of an action or occurence often go in the mid position:
