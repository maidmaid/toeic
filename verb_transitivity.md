# Verb transitivity

**Transitive** (`Vn`) must have a direct object.

Transitive verbs always have an object.

- John ate `lunch`.
- Jane called `me` yesterday.
- The boy ripped `the paper` at the beach.
- My Mummy cooks `dinner` for the Mafia. (for the Mafia = prepositional phrase)

**Intransitive** (`V`) can take an indirect object.

An indirect object is a preposition + noun, or an adverb.

- The car stopped `in the driveway`.
- My mummy cookds `for the mafia`.
- The girl cried `for a long time`.

**Di-transitive** (`Vnn`) must have both a _direct_ and _indirect_ object.

- My mummy cooks `me` (IO) `dinner` (O) every day.
- My friend told `me` (IO) `a story` (O).
- Damien always reads `his children` (IO) `bedtime stories` (O).

Example:

- Transitive: My mother reads `books` (O).
- Intransitive: My mother reads `to me` (IO).
- Di-transitive: My mother reads `me` (IO) `books` (O).
