## Aderbs

Normally `adverbs` are words that describe `verbs`.

Adverbs answer the following questions about verbs:

> How? When? Where? Why?

These examples show how adverbs modify verbs:

- He `easily` lifted the suitcase into the car.
  - How did he lift the suitcase? `Easily`
  - `Easily` is an adverb.
- We'll use the new software program `tomorrow`.
  - When will we use it? `Tomorrow`.
  - `Tomorrow` functions as an adverb.
- She parked the car `nearby`.
  - Where did she park the car? `Nearby`.
  - Nearby is an adverb.

Adverbs are the most moveable of all parts of speech. Examples:

1. `Slowly` he climbed the ladder.
2. *He `slowly` climbed the ladder*.(most common)
3. He climbed the ladder `slowly`.

Many adverbs end in `-ly`. Most abverbs are formed by adding `-ly` + `adjectives`:

- nice + ly = nicely
- drowsy + ly = drowsily
- quick + ly = quickly
- :warning: friendly = adjective

Like adjectives of more than one syllable, adverbs usually become **comparative** (more) and **superlative** (most). Examples:

- Tom played the tune `lyrically`.
- Jon played the tune more `lyrically` than Tom. (**Comparative**)
- Andrew played the tune most `lyrically`. (**Superlative**)
