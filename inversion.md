# Inversion

## What is inversion?

> Inversion is when we change the subject and the finite verb in the sentences.

## When do we use it?

We use inversion to show emphasis or authority.

Common ways to use inversion are with negative or near negative adverbs.

For example:

- Negative: `no`, `not` or `never`. (True negatives)
- Near negative: `hardly ever`, `rarely`, `seldom`, `not nearly`, `unfortunate`, `no sooner`, etc. (They are all below sometimes)

Inverted sentences must always have:

1. an `anxiliary verb`,
2. a `negative` or `near negative adverb`.

Example:

- I have `never` eaten pizza.

  :arrow_right: `Never` have I eaten pizza.
- I `rarely` go to the beach.

  :arrow_right: `Rarely` do I go to the beach. (Sentences with only one verb require an anxiliary too to do inversion.)
- My friend `seldom` eats tomato.

  :arrow_right: `Seldom` does my friend eat tomato.
- I had `no sooner` eaten lunch `than` my boss called me.

  :arrow_right: `No sooner` had I eaten lunch `than` my boss called me. (Formal language).

  :information_source: I had just eaten my lunch `when` my boss called me. (Informal)
- I had `hardly` (just) graduated from university `when` I got a great job.

  I had `hardly` (just) graduated from university `than` I was contacted by my new boss.

  Hardly had I gratuated from univerty when I got a great job.
- `Rarely` have I seen such beauty.

  `Rarely` do I eat raclette because I never get the chance.
- Never do I play video game, watch TV, or use the internet.

## No sooner ... than, hardly ... than, ... when

### No sooner - almost no break.

- I called the pizza shop and the pizza came `straight away`.
- `No sooner` had I called the pizza shop `than` it arrived.
- `No sooner` had I got home `than` the phone rang.

### Hardly

Example 1:

- I had `hardly` finished my first year of university when the second one began.

  :arrow_right: `Hardly` had I finished my first year of university `than` the second one began.
- I had `hardly` finished talking to my friend on the phone `when` he arrived at my door.

  :arrow_right: `Hardly` had I finished talking to my friend on the phone `when` he arrived at my door.

## If conditionnal

`Only if` = a rule or condition, like must.

- You must eat all your vegetables or you cannot play with your friends.

  :arrow_right: `Only if` you eat all your vegetables can you play with your friends.
- You can leave work at 5pm if you finish all your tasks.

  If you finish all your tasks, you can leave work at 5pm.

  :arrow_right: Only if you finish your tasks, can you leave work at 5pm.
