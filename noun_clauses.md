# Noun clauses

Definition:

> A noun clause is a dependent clause which contains a subject and a verb. It is used like a noun and can never stand alone.

5 types:

1. subjects
2. objects
3. objects of the preposition
4. noun complement (nominal relative clause)
5. adjective complement

In order to confidently understand nouns clauses, it is important to understand all five types of structures.

## 1. Subjects

### It + be + complement + NC

The noun clause (NC) is the subject. "It" is what we call an "expletive" (empty subject).

- It is important `that you go to the meeting`.

### NC + V

The noun clause (NC) is the subject.

- `That you go to the meeting` is important.
- `What you said` was interesting.

Note that is more formal to use noun clauses as subjects.

### S + be + NC

The noun clause (NC) is the subject complement.

- The probleme is `that he never lestens to me`.

Because the noun clause is the subject complement, we can turn the sentence around without changing the meaning:

- `That he never listens to me` is the problem.
- `What you think` is `what I tkink`. `What I think` is `what you think`.

## 2. Objects

### S + V (transitive verb) + NC / S + V (transitive verb) + O + NC

The noun clause (NC) is the direct object.

- She said `that she wanted to bux the car`.
- Do you know `where the nearest post office is`?
- I don't know `how I should write this letter`.

Note that noun clauses as objects are used after transitive verbs or di-transitive verbs (2 objects).

## 3. Object of the Preposition (indirect objects)

### Prep + noun clause

The noun clause (NC) is the object of the preposition.

- I am sorry `for what I said to you`.
- I am thinking `about what I should say in my speech`.

Note that we cannot use "that" after a preposition.

## 4. Noun complement / Nominal Relative clause

### Noun + nc

The noun clause (NC) is a noun complement.

- The news `that he got the job` was a surprise.
- The reason `why he quit his job` is unknown.
- The hotel `where we stayed` was nice.
- The year `that I graduated` was 1995.

This is the most difficult type of noun clase for students to understand and create. This is because it is often confused with a "relative clause". A noun complement looks very similar to a relative clause, and is sometimes called a "nominal relative clause". However, it is important that both students and teachers clearly understand the differences.

In front of a noun complement, we use a noun. Because of this, students often mistake this noun to be the antecedent of the relative clause. However, because the antecedent is not the subject, object, or object of the preposition of the noun clause, it is not a relative clause.

Instead the noun is just a complement as it has the same meaning or information as the noun clause. Therefore, we can remove the noun and just use the noun clause. We cannot do this with relative clauses.

- The news `that he got the job` was great.
- The news was great.
- `That he got the job` was great.

## 5. Adjective complement

### adjective + NC

The noun clause (NC) is an adjective complement.

- I am happy `that I met you`.
- I was surprised `that he didn't go the party`.

We can not use adjective + wh~ (e.g. what, where...).

Do not confuse "It + be + complement + NC" with "adjective + NC".

- It is important `that you study hard`.

`that you study hard` comes after a subject, but because of its structure, it is not an adjective complement; it is the subject of the sentence.

## Remember this

1. The only clause marker that can be taken out is "that".

   I told you (that) I am not a student.

   We cannot take out "that" when it is **at the front** of the sentence because it makes the **subject**.
2. When we use "Noun + Noun Clause", we can only use 4 markers: "When, Why, That and Where".

   We often use "what" insted of "when" and "why".

   Never use "that" to replace "where" because this creates a Relative Clause.
3. We often use "what" instead of "which".

   "Which" is better to use when you are talking about a choice.
4. When we use "which + noun" or "what + noun" we can not use a determiner in front of it.
5. "Whether" and "if" have the same meaning when using the object preposition.

   We cannot use "if" to create subjects. "Whether" is more natural.
6. With "whether" and "if" we often use "or not".

   We can also say "whether or not" but we cannot say "if or not".
7. "How" is the marker, which requires the most attention.

   Therefore, it is the most tested noun clause marker.
